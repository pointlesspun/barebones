The BareBones framework is a minimal bare-bones set of code to get a Unity-based game up and running quickly. The intention is to have an end-to-end solution which does as little as possible in a clear and consise manner, making it easy to configure, add or remove assets as needed. ... Provided the user is somewhat fluent in Unity and coding.
